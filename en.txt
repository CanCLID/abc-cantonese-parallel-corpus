You're a voter, so you should know that providing false registration information to an electoral officer and afterwards going to cast a vote like that is considered vote-rigging. That's breaking the law, so for heaven's sake don't do that!
Today when getting off work I was quite tired and wanted to go home and sleep. As luck would have it as I was walking along I got stopped by a cop. He said he wanted to check my identity (ID) card and telephone, and then he asked me what line of work I was in, and where I worked, and after that he even searched my body
I have bought a poodle. It's a female. Originally I thought I could put up with her, but lately she is really hard to take care of. The whole day she chews on shoes. I scold her but she pays no attention. At night she barks. I really can't tolerate her!

I bought a restaurant coupon for one hundred dollars. It said the original price was five hundred dollars; after going to the restaurant to eat I knew it wasn't worth the money. It turns out they told such a big lie, my wife said to me it was too good to be true
Last night I was riding my bicycle on the road in my estate to return home. Both my front and back lights were all lit. A taxi opposite me didn't use its signal light, and when it was driving on my right front side it suddenly turned in toward my left. Luckily I was able to stop in time. Otherwise I would have been hit hard!
My older brother has become a completely changed person. He's always arguing with Dad. He also says he wants to divorce his wife. He's also rejected his daughter, his two eyes look very strange. Damn, maybe he's had a magic spell cast on him by a shaman. Now we don't know what to do about it!
The World Health Organization's standard is that two point five fine particulate matter shouldn't exceed twenty-five micrograms (per cubic meter), but the government is incapable of solving the air pollution problem, so it flouts and ignores the international standard, and adopts a relatively looser and more favorable standard of seventy-five micrograms

I'm a hotel valet parking attendant. All things considered it's a five-star hotel I work at. I've really parked a lot of nice cars: Benz, Bentley, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Rolls-Royce. If you ask me what nice cars I haven't driven, I think there aren't necessarily any!
The full length of this dash cam video is three minutes. In the dash cam video the time of recording is indicated as yesterday (the third) at about four o'clock in the afternoon.
